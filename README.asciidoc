| dp, tree, connectivity
| Find a minimum connected subgraph and together with all its neighbors cover
all the nodes in the orignial graph.
| State compression dp, `connected[state]=true` iff `state` is a mask for
connected subgraph. Then `connected[state \| (1<<v)]=true`, `v` is a neighbor
of mask `state`.
